# 100 Days of Data Science

# Day 1: Introduction, Setup, and Reviewing Python Basics

## Tasks for the Day

### 1. Introduction to the 100-Day Portfolio Challenge
Today, I am kicking off my 100-Day Data Science Portfolio Challenge. I will start by writing an introductory post outlining my goals and motivations for starting this challenge. I will explain the benefits of having a strong portfolio and how this challenge will help me achieve my career objectives in data science. I will also create a detailed introduction post on my Google site.

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup
I will create a GitHub repository dedicated to my 100-day challenge. I will set up the repository with a basic structure, including folders for each week and a main README file. I will make my first commit with the initial structure.

### 3. Review Python Basics
Today, I will review essential Python concepts that are crucial for data science. I will focus on core programming skills to ensure I have a strong foundation.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Data types and structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Control flow (if statements, for loops, while loops)
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- Error and exception handling

### 4. Document My Learning
I will create a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script with well-documented code snippets and explanations for each Python concept reviewed. I will add this document to the GitHub repository in a folder named "Day 1 - Python Basics".

### 5. Reflect and Share
I will write a reflection on the day's learning process, challenges faced, and insights gained. I will share this reflection on my Google site and link to my GitHub repository.
