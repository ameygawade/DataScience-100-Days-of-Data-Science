    "In Day 7, we've covered essential concepts such as Hypothesis Testing, Test Statistics, p-Values, and Confidence Intervals. These statistical tools are fundamental for analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and making decisions based on evidence in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- Hypothesis Testing: \n",
    "    - A method for making decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "- Test Statistics: \n",
    "    - These are calculated values used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis, depending on the hypothesis being tested.\n",
    "- p-Values: \n",
    "    - A measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Confidence Intervals: \n",
    "    - Provide a range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall, giving more context to point estimates by showing uncertainty.\n",
